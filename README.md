# Demo API

[![Black Code Style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/ambv/black)

This is a Django API boilerplate project that uses Docker and Docker Compose for a consistent and easy development environment. It also includes Postgres for the database, Celery for background task processing, and the Django Rest Framework for building APIs. The project is written in Python and follows best practices for Django development. It can be used as a starting point for building your own Django-powered APIs.

## Technologies

- [Python 3.10](https://python.org): Base programming language for development
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/): Application relational databases for development, staging and production environments
- [Django Framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/): Development framework used for the application
- [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) : Provides API development tools for easy API development
- [Celery](https://github.com/celery/celery): A simple, flexible, and reliable distributed system to process vast amounts of tasks
- [Redis](https://github.com/redis/redis-py): A NoSQL Database that serves as Cache, Celery Broker and Result Backend
- [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/): An Email Service Provider for sending emails
- [Docker Engine and Docker Compose](https://www.docker.com/) : Containerization of the application and services orchestration

## How To Start App

- Clone the Repository
- create a .env file with the variables in the .env.example file
  - `cp env.example .env`
  - You will also need to create an account with [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) and get an API Key. You will need to add this to the .env file

- Run `make build-dev`

  - Running the above command for the first time will download all docker-images and third party packages needed for the app.
  - **NB: This will take several minutes for the first build**

- Run `make up-dev`

  - Running the above command will Start up the following Servers:
    - Postgres Server --> http://localhost:5432
    - Django Development Server --> http://localhost:8000
    - Redis Server --> http://localhost:6379

- Run `make down-dev` to stop the servers

- Run `make test` to run tests

- Other commands can be found in the Makefile

## Exploring The App

Make sure that all the above servers are running before you start exploring the project.
